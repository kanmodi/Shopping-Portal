# Shopping-Portal
This project aims to help buyers shop for products like shoes, mobile phones, clothes etc. It serves as an online portal where buyers can keep track of their orders and products available. 
The welcome page includes a search bar where the user browse for products available on the e commerce portal irrespective of whether the user is logged in or not. The user can either login to an existing account or create a new one using their unique email id. The password has to be at least 5 characters long. The signing up process requires the user to enter personal details like name, username, date of birth, valid phone number, gender and their billing as well as delivery address. A user cannot register with the same email id again. Also, the user can access the products without logging in. User can search for product by typing the product name or relevant keyword in the search bar. Availability of stock for each product is also maintained.  
The user can view or edit his account details, view or edit his basket or log out of the account. Our basket includes name of the products, quantity of each product taken and total price of each product. 
After browsing through the products user can check out for the items selected by his desired mode of payment. After the order is in process, the quantity of that product is automatically decremented in the store.
